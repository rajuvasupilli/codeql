# Using the Venafi Terraform Module

This guide provides instructions on how to utilize the Venafi Terraform module to automate the provisioning and management of SSL/TLS certificates within your AWS environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Venafi Terraform module, ensure you have the following:

- **Venafi API Access:** Obtain OAuth credentials for authentication with the Venafi platform.
- **AWS Credentials:** Configure AWS credentials with permissions to interact with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

## Module Variables:

Configure the following variables when using the module:
 - instance_count: Number of instances requiring certificates.
 - hostname: The hostname for the certificate.
 - environment: Deployment environment (e.g., nonprod, prod).
 - region: AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
 - account_id: AWS account ID.
 - cert_sans: Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for the certificate.









## Security Considerations:

**Authentication:** Ensure that OAuth credentials for Venafi are securely stored and managed.
**Access Control:** Limit AWS IAM permissions to only those necessary for certificate management.
**Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring to track certificate issuance and usage.
